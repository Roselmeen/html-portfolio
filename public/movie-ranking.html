<h1>The Best Movies According to Rosel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>The Safe Haven</h3>
<p>
    As the name suggests us it is a very "HAVEN" movie for me with casting of josh duhamel, julanne hough and cameo of cobie smulders it did justice to the characters.<br />
    It also provides us the eye calming nature picturization with calming background music of canoeing and a pinch of mytery makes it binds us to the end of the movie.

<h3>The Kashmir Files</h3>
<p>
    The Indian film which shows horror of the holocaustic event of a pandit community shared in the year 1990. It will breaks your heart and soul and will show
    the cruel nautre of the human being for whom religion is far more greater than the humanism.

<h3>Veer Savarkar</h3>
<p>
    The unsung freedom fighter of indian indipendence based on real life stories of V.D.Savarkar
    on how the so called freedom fighters are and how comfartable they are to the british east india company.<br />
    With outstanding cast of Randeep Hooda this movie is worth watching for today's generation youth as it depicts
    how wretched life of a real freedom fighter is.
